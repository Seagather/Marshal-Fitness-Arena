## User experience

![responsive](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/assets/images/responsive.png)

The website has been built to look great on both mobile and desktop devices with the exception of adding Javascript to implement complex features and interactive elements to enhance user experience.
The structure transforms accordingly across all devices. The colors were essential to communicate visual aesthetic state of mind to viewers, subconciously creating the urge to know more while conciously increasing the desire to gym at Marshal Fitness Arena.

I used [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com) which utilised smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of PNG and JPG files. This shrunk the image size to 41%.
the site uses less bandwith and load faster.

## FEATURES
* Background hero image on home page with dark overlay and and carousel-fade displaying motivational quotes to keep your eyes glued to the screen.
* Carousel-slide to showcase gym facilities in an enabling environment.
* Call-to-action buttons strategically positioned and escalated to get you signed Up.
* The call-to-action button triggers a chain reaction that cascades to the last point of call.
* Upon clicking the **Join Us Now!** button on any of the [Classes](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/classes.html) a modal form pops up with all the input components validated. 
  clicking **Submit** further triggers a second modal with a post-feedback success reaction depicted with thumbs-up, a fontawesome icon.
  The feedback modal can take you back to homepage upon clicking the web logo. 
  Again there's a line below the feedback modal customized to launch a quick follow-up call or enquiries.
* Fading overlay opacity effect on the card images upon hover displays the timetable for each class session.

## FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT 
* There is an urge to implement Javascript, like adding interactivity and automation. Things like video players, interactive maps and form validatiion can foster user experience.


## Visual identity
* [LogoMaker](https://logomaker.com) was used for the logo design

## TESTING

## Speed Test
The Initial speed performance test generated a poor loading analysis which necessitated the use of Tinypng to shrink the image size to 41%.
The page sizes were reduced and the perfomance score was improved as seen below:

Website was tested on [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) and [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com) platforms.

## Bugs

* The hero image tends to display with a lower horizontal scrollbar on Microsoft Edge browser.
* The homepage is not properly displaying on iPhoneXR. The call to action button shifts towards the left with an opening gap between the contact details.
* The navbar toggler was not displaying properly initially, I fixed this by setting the margin to mr-4 and created a fixed size for it.

## Removed features

* The Initially plan was to use video display as homepage but because of the inability to stop/disable the video without using Javascript. 
  This feature was unattainable without Languages outside the scope of this project. I had to recourse to using hero image as homepage.
